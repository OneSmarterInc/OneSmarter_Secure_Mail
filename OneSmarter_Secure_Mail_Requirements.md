# OneSmarter Secure Mail — handoff v1.1 retirement notice

Version 1.1 • 29 October 2026 • BA, engineering, QA, security and operations

## Status and authoritative sources

The developer/BA handoff v1.0 dated 27 October 2026 is **retired as an
implementation or acceptance specification**. This includes downloaded copies
named `OneSmarter_Secure_Mail_Requirements (1).md`. Preserve old exports only as
historical evidence; do not implement their endpoint tables, provider choices,
architecture or prototype-status columns. This notice supersedes that baseline;
it does not rewrite copies already distributed outside this repository.

Use these version-controlled documents together:

| Subject | Authoritative source |
| --- | --- |
| Product behavior, permissions, decisions, scope | [PRD.md](PRD.md) |
| Architecture and tools | [TECH_STACK.md](TECH_STACK.md) |
| Actual API contract | [API_REFERENCE.md](API_REFERENCE.md), checked against `backend/config/urls.py` |
| UI implementation/design | `frontend/src/` and [DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) |
| Crypto/key custody | [KEY_MANAGEMENT.md](KEY_MANAGEMENT.md), [KEY_SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE.md](KEY_SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| Storage/retention | [DATA_RETENTION.md](DATA_RETENTION.md) |
| Release permission and unresolved security evidence | [RELEASE_GATES.md](RELEASE_GATES.md) |
| Test evidence and progress | [TESTING.md](TESTING.md), [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) |

If code and PRD disagree, record a defect or an approved requirement change.
Code is evidence of implementation, not automatic authority to change a product
requirement. An internal test result cannot override a release gate.

## Material changes since v1.0

- Django/React staff authentication, MFA, recipient OTP, secure intake, storage,
  scanning, threaded responses and administration are implemented for synthetic
  use. The original static prototype is historical; no private hosted prototype
  link is required to use or review this repository.
- Private Email was selected for local SMTP testing. Production requires an
  approved company-domain sender, a credential mapping and verified domain
  authentication. Provider/mailbox selection for that production configuration
  is pending; neither the old Proton assumption nor a successful SMTP test is
  production approval. See [SMTP_SENDERS.md](SMTP_SENDERS.md).
- OSIVault and AWS KMS are excluded. OneSmarter owns the current hybrid candidate
  and isolated operator-unsealed key service. No independent approval is claimed.
- Uploaded documents target persistent storage attached to the AWS app instance;
  off-instance backup destination, retention and recovery targets remain open.
- Secure-information requests allow a blank body and always stay protected.
  Recipient endpoints use `/recipient-api/`; use the API reference instead of the
  retired invitation-path table.
- Test counts are dated evidence, not a permanent total or certification. Use
  TESTING.md and actual CI results; skipped integrations are not passes.

## Change control

Each material decision change must update the PRD decision register and affected
architecture/API/operations documents in the same change. Add dated evidence to
ROADMAP/TESTING when behavior is verified. A release reviewer must check for
contradictory active documents and identify the exact commit under review.
BA owns requirement acceptance, engineering owns implementation evidence, and
security/release owners approve the applicable production gates. Named owners,
external review budget and sign-off records still need assignment; this notice
is not their approval.
